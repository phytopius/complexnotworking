# complexnotworking

I downloaded the checkpoint.zip file from 111.Checkpoint files and continued to implement all chapters until 122.
Sadly for me the project is not working. It seems like nginx does not have access to a index.html file other than the default one.

I am running this on Windows.

My output at http://localhost:3050/ looks like this  https://i.imgur.com/vij2OXD.png

I hope anyone can point me into the right direction
